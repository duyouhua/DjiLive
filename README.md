Broadcast your live video from RC controller app to Facebook Live Video feed


This solution was created by me for people who using the old phantoms (3 ADV/PRO) and don't have a built-in support for Facebook Live like in Phantom 4.

I'm using the regular DJI SDK for Android and Facebook SDK for video managament.
The idea is to create a useful tool for people who want share a live video feed.
